# From In-Depth Analysis to 3D Visualization: Understanding Tourism in China and South Korea Through Data

## Introduction
This project aims to provide an in-depth analysis and interactive 3D visualization of tourism data for China and South Korea. 
The primary objective is to create an engaging and intuitive visualization that allows users to explore complex datasets on visitor arrivals. 
The project highlights various demographic factors, such as age, gender, country of origin, and crew numbers, and also includes predictive modeling to forecast future trends.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Aki120900/big_data_torusm_China_and_S.Korea.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd big_data_torusm_China_and_S.Korea
    ```
3. Install the required Python packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. **Jupyter Notebooks**: Use the provided Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis:
    - `region_country_visits.ipynb`
    - `visitors_by_gender.ipynb`
    - `visitors_by_age.ipynb`
    - `visitors_by_crew.ipynb`
    - `Predictive_Modeling.ipynb`

2. **Interactive 3D Visualization**:
    - Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the interactive 3D visualization.
    - The visualization allows users to explore visitor data by different demographics, providing insights into tourism patterns.

## Features
- **Data Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of visitor arrivals by country/region, gender, age, and crew numbers.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Machine learning models to forecast future tourism trends.
- **Interactive Visualization**: A 3D data visualization created using p5.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Dependencies
- **Python Libraries**:
    - pandas
    - numpy
    - matplotlib
    - plotly
    - scikit-learn
- **Web Technologies**:
    - p5.js
    - HTML/CSS
    - JavaScript

## Configuration
- Ensure that all required datasets are available in the `data` directory.
- The `index.html` file sets up the basic structure of the web page and includes the p5.js library and the main visualization code in `sketch.js`.

## Documentation
Detailed documentation of the project is available in the `Big data documentation.pdf` file. It includes:
